#### 🏫 I am a recently graduated Masters student from the University of Virginia 
#### ⛅ At UVA, I studied how tropical high cloud feedbacks drive spread in climate sensitivity across fully-coupled global climate models
#### 🤔 I am currently working on understanding how the response of convective characteristics to warming drives spread in tropical high cloud feedbacks
